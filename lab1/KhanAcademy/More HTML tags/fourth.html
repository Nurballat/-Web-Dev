        <h2 id="chicken">Baked Sweet and Sour Chicken Thighs with Pineapple</h2>
        <p> This baked sweet and sour chicken made with chicken thighs and pineapple is a "dump" version of one of the most popular dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Skip the deep frying and bake everything together in one dish to create a lighter twist on a classic with no sacrifice of flavor. </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish or spray with cooking spray.
<br><strong>Step 2:</strong>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, cut into 1-inch chunks, and add to the dish. Sprinkle with cornstarch, and toss until chicken is coated. Stir in onions, green and red bell peppers, and pineapple.
<br><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add ketchup, rice vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger paste to a small bowl, whisk until well combined, and stir into the chicken mixture.
<br><strong>Step 4:</strong>Bake until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 14 to 17 minutes, stirring halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). If sauce is a bit thick, stir in a splash of water to thin out until you reach your desired consistency.
<br><strong>Step 5:</strong>Garnish with green onion slices and serve.

    <h2 id="kuyrdak">Kuyrdak</h2>
        <p> Kuyrdak is a traditional meat dish made in Central Asia. The name comes from a nominalisation of the word "roast", "fried", referring to how the food is made. It is described as "stewed brown meat". <br>

Kuyrdak is known in Turkish cuisine as kavurma usually made from lamb, mutton, beef, or sheep liver, or sometimes with vegetables. </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Fry the onions together with the organs and the lambeat for 10 minutes on lowheat.
Except for the liver! All organs and the meat should be cut into bite size chunks.
<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> After frying for 10 minutes add the salt, blackpepper and lamb seasoning. Stir and fry on low heat for another 5 minutes!
<br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now add water until the meat is covered and reduce it for 20 minutes.
<br><strong>Step 4:</strong> After 20 minutes put the potato chunks on top of the meat so the meat is covered.Dont stir! The potatos have to be on top to get steamed. Now let that boil for another 20 minutes on low heat.There should be little water left.
<br><strong>Step 5:</strong> When the time has passed add the liver chunks, give it a stir and let the “Kuyrdak” boil for 10 more minutes. The water should be reduced and the meat and potato mix has a creamy consistency like a hearty gulash. Taste the dish and plate it. Add salt if needed and garnish your plate with fresh dill. Have some black tea and nan bread to get the real kazakh experience.
